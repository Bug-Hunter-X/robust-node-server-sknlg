# Node.js Server: Insufficient Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js server development: insufficient error handling. The `server.js` file contains code with a try-catch block that doesn't properly handle potential errors. This can lead to unexpected server behavior or crashes, and obscure the root cause of problems.

The `serverSolution.js` file provides a solution with improved error handling, demonstrating best practices for responding appropriately to different error scenarios in a Node.js server.
